# steadystate
Matlab-based semi-automated routine to detect the optimum combination of first new steady-state friction point following a friction velocity step and the associated slip window to accurately operate a linear detrend starting the new steady-state point in order to determine accurate rate- and state- friction parameter values from inverse modelling.
